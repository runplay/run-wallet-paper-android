<b>run Iota paper</b> provides a Paper wallet and digital encrypted Hybrid Master Slave wallets for IOTA
<br/><br/>
<b>Html encrypted digital wallets</b><br/><br/>
The Master Digital wallet simply provides access to the Seed, encrypted with SHA-256 and compiled to a self contained html file, run anywhere.
<br/><br/>
The Slave / View wallet provides ledger access to view the Addresses on the seed, without the need for the Seed, encrypted with SHA-256, attach them and start receiving IOTA.
<br/><br/>
A simple use case scenario: Boss generates Master and Slave wallets, keeps master (Seed) and gives Slave (Viewer) wallets to Accounts and Sales departments safe in the knowledge that the Seed is never given out, but both departments get full view access to the transactions.
<br/><br/>
There are no spend functions with run IOTA paper, it is designed to only receive IOTA payments, with separation between Seed owner and people (staff) with permission to view the transfer on the Seed.
